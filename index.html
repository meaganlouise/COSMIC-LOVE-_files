          >“Astrology is the study of cycles. By observing the cyclical
          movements of the planets, we are able to gain a greater understanding
          of the cycles and patterns in our own lives. Astrology can be a
          powerful tool for healing and transformation, and it can be a key that
          can unlock a greater spiritual connection to the universe. Although
          astrology is not fortune-telling, when skillfully applied, astrology
          can be an extremely effective predictive tool. On a personal level,
          astrology…can give us insight into our personal issues, our patterns,
          our fears, and our dreams…Astrology is a tool that can help us
          understand and unlock our highest potentials, and that can teach us
          how to live in harmony with the universe.”
